Hi guys

if you want to try the project just check in the application.properties:
spring.datasource.url = jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/hospital

in my case that was the local host and i create a schema call hospital, i suggest to do the same

run the project, and with post man you can create new specialities and patients just look at what the dtos are asking
and that would be it.
